# Android-Tween-Animation-Sample
This is the second project I have done under UpSchool-Android bootcamp. In this project, we were asked to create an XML animation file using all of the tween animation alpha, scale, translate, rotate properties and start the animation on an imageview. The *fly* button starts an animation that includes all of these features.
